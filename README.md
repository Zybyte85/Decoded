# Programming concepts made easy
A repository of short and easy descriptions of simple to complex programming concepts.

I want to make docs explaining many programming conceptsâ€”everything from variables and functions to inheritance and composition.

# Contributing
Here are a few ways you can help:
- Write documentation
- Check general grammar/factual mistakes
- Help with a website
- Create an issue about a concept you would like described
  
Any contributions are much appreciated :)
