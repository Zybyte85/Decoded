# Programming concepts made easy
A repository of short and easy descriptions of simple to complex programming concepts.

I want to make docs explaining many programming conceptsâ€”everything from variables and functions to inheritance and composition.

# Contributing
If you can, please write docs about something you are knowledgeable about. Or help make a website. Whatever you do will help :)
